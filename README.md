## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 18.x or later recommended)
*   pnpm (version 9.x or later recommended)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
# This is used by the MastraChat component if you are using a hosted Mastra agent.
# For this project's current setup, the agent is defined locally in app/api/mastra/chat/route.ts,
# so this might not be strictly necessary unless other parts of Mastra components expect it.
NEXT_PUBLIC_MASTRA_AGENT_URL="your_mastra_agent_url_if_applicable"
```

Replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd wt-sqlly-83 # Or your project directory name
    ```

2.  Install dependencies using pnpm:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `.next` directory.
